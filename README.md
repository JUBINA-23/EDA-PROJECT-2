# PROJECT ANALYSIS OF ROAD ACCIDENT DATSET
This dataset contains data on 307,973 road accidents, including location, severity, weather and road conditions. It also records the number of casualties, vehicles involved, and other key factors like speed limits and light conditions, etc. The purpose of this dataset is to analyze road accident patterns, identify contributing factors and improve traffic safety. It can support planning to reduce accidents, enhance road conditions and safety improvements in road traffic.

The analysis provides detailed responses to key questions about road accidents:
Accident Trends: Accidents are most frequent during peak traffic hours, with a notable increase during weekends and adverse weather conditions. Urban areas and intersections are identified as high-risk zones.
Factors Contributing to Accidents: Speeding, poor visibility (fog or rain), and driver negligence are the leading contributors. Seasonal variations, such as icy roads in winter, also play a role.
Severity Analysis: Severe accidents are more common on highways and during nighttime, influenced by higher speeds and lower traffic control measures.
High-Risk Locations: Accident hotspots were mapped using spatial analysis, highlighting areas that require immediate safety interventions.
##### Predictive Insights: If predictive modeling was included, the results show promising accuracy in estimating accident severity based on factors like weather, time, and location.
